# Tensorflow
This notebook implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to use an RNN, specifically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, to classify these images.
Key Components:
1.	Imports and Setup: Essential libraries like TensorFlow, Keras layers, and NumPy are imported. Dataset parameters and network parameters are initialized, including learning rate, batch size, and number of training steps.
2.	Data Processing: The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed. Each image is treated as a sequence of 28 rows, where each row (28 pixels) represents a timestep in the RNN.
3.	Model Architecture: A sequential model is built with one LSTM layer followed by a fully connected layer (dense). The LSTM layer processes the sequence data, while the dense layer makes predictions for digit classification.
4.	Loss, Optimization, and Accuracy: The cross-entropy loss function is used to calculate the error between predicted and true labels. The Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss, and the accuracy function measures the performance of the model during training.
5.	Training: The model is trained in a loop using mini batches of data. The optimization process updates the model’s weights based on gradients calculated during each iteration. After every 100 steps, the model’s loss and accuracy are printed to track training progress.
This code provides a practical example of using an RNN for sequence data classification, treating each image row as a sequence to be processed by the LSTM network.
